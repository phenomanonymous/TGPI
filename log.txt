player can now only teleport once before landing on the ground or a sticky block
added gravity-inverting blocks
added falling/vanishing blocks
a whole FUCKTON of cleanup and reorganization (desperately needed)
gravity blocks are bugged
fixed gravity
fixed teleport ghost flip
fixed normal collisions
increased bounce factor from -1.1 -> -1.2
created global constant player jumps to keep track of # of jumps left
	- this is for possible future development of double or multi-jumping
undid the jump number bullshit because what the fuck everything broke
